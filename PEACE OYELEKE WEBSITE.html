        <h2>What is Atelectasis?</h2>
        <p>Atelectasis is a medical term for collapse of a lung or portion of a lung.
            Atelectasis can be, <strong> resorptive/obstructive, or contraction.</strong> 
            Compressive atelectasis is when fluid, air, blood or a tumor presses on alveoli from the outside. 
            Resorptive atelectasis happens when no new air can move into the alveoli (for instance, there's a blockage).

        </p>

    <div id="Causes">
        <h3>Causes Of Atelectasis</h3>
        Surgery is the most common cause of atelectasis. When anesthesia is used during surgery to keep you asleep, you donâ€™t breathe deeply enough to fill your lungs all the way or cough to clear your lungs of mucus. 
        This can lead to blockages or lack of air to the alveoli, causing resorptive atelectasis.
        It can also be caused by variety of factors such as infection, blockage or injury.
