        <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
        <p>
            Carbohydrates provide the energy needed to perform the important functions of the body and to keep it active.
            Only some carbohydrate sources are nutritious, as refined carbohydrates lack essential elements that promote health, such as, vitamins, dietary fiber and minerals. These nutritional substances are vital for normal functioning of our body because they contain hydrogen, carbon and oxygen, which our body is made of. During digestion glucose is released by carbohydrates, and transported to different organs through the blood. The cells of the organs convert carbohydrates into energy.
             To gain your daily dosage of energy consume t foods like vegetables, pasta, bread and whole grains.
